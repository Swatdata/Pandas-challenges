Here we will add `.{0,7}` at the beginning of the search: this means we will find all `apple iphone`'s that have 7 or less characters preceding the term \"apple iphone\" - if there's 8 characters preceding the search term, it won't be found. This should help refine our search by using the nomenclature of the DataFrame to our advantage.\n","\n","If you feel unsure about regex, please use [regex101](https://regex101.com/).
